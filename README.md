# Home Assistant sensor component/integration for Itho Wifi
This integration for Home Assistant provides a configuration screen for the MQTT based "Itho Wifi add-on" from https://github.com/arjenhiemstra/ithowifi
This simplifies the integration by creating the sensors for the various Itho Daalderop devices: Heatpump WPU 5G, HRU units, CVE boxes, Autotemp units for floor heating. 

This custom component has no affiliation with the Itho Daalderop company or with Arjen Hiemstra's Itho WiFi add-on.

## What can be configured via this Integration
1. Autotemp sensors with up to 10 autotemp rooms using custom room names instead of Room 1, Room 2
2. Heatpump WPU sensors
3. CVE sensors
4. NON-CVE / HRU sensors
5. Up to 5 remotes for monitoring CO2 levels for CVE/NON-CVE (HRU) with custom names.

> [!NOTE]
> **Auto-detect**
>
> The integration provides an auto-detect option for all of your Itho WiFi Add-ons. This requires:
> - v2.9.0 or higher of the [WiFi Add-on system firmware](https://github.com/arjenhiemstra/ithowifi/releases)
> - A MQTT message containing your device information. The integration will wait for at least 6 seconds to receive a MQTT message. By default the WiFi Add-on sends an update every 5 seconds, but if you change this to anything higher than 5, your device might not be found.

### Fan entity
The integration creates a Fan entity for several devices which can be used to control the speed and/or mode. Currently the following devices and actions are provided:

#### CVE / HRU ECO 200
| HA action | Device action | 
|---|---|
| Set % | Sets % |
| Turn on | Sets preset mode to `High` |
| Turf off | Sets % to 0 |
| Preset mode<sup>*</sup> | Sets to corresponding preset mode |

\* Supported preset modes are `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Timer 10`, `Timer 20`, `Timer 30`

> [!NOTE]
> **Setting Fan preset mode works as fire-and-forget**
> 
> The CVE / HRU ECO 200 don't provide information on their current preset. Setting a preset from a physical (RF)remote is currently impossible to know for the integration.


#### HRU ECO 250/300
| HA action | Device action | 
|---|---|
| Turn on | Sets preset mode to `High` |
| Turf off | Sets preset mode to `Auto` |
| Preset mode<sup>*</sup> | Sets to corresponding preset mode |

\* Supported preset modes are `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Auto`, `Auto (night)`, `Timer 10`, `Timer 20`, `Timer 30`

> [!NOTE]
> **Setting Fan preset mode works as fire-and-forget**
> 
> The HRU ECO 250/300 don't provide information on their current preset. Setting a preset from a physical (RF)remote is currently impossible to know for the integration.

#### HRU ECO 350
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requires a successfully paired virtual remote
> 
> `Medium` preset requires a virtual remote that provides this mode, for example `RFT CO2`

| HA action | Device action | 
|---|---|
| Turn on | Sets preset mode to `High` |
| Turf off | Sets preset mode to `Auto` |
| Preset mode<sup>*</sup> | Sets to corresponding preset mode |

\* Supported preset modes are `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Auto`, `Auto (night)`, `Timer 10`, `Timer 20`, `Timer 30`

## Differences with the Itho WiFi add-on Home Assistant MQTT Discovery
Custom autotemp roomnames and CO2 remote names are also unique to this integration.  

Additional differences include the translations in Dutch, support for other Itho devices besides a fan, value translations for e.g. status. 

## Use-case
This integration should eliminate the manual creation via YAML of sensors for:
* Non-CVE (HRU) like Actual mode, Supply Temp, Supply / Exhaust RPM, Bypass 
* CVE like Humidity, Temperature, Speed
* Autotemp like Power kW, Power %, Set Point Temp, Actual Temp per Room
* CO2 concencration for supported remotes
* WPU like Pump Percentage, Boiler Temp, From / To Source Temps, Operating Mode etc


## Advanced configuration
The integration has an option for advanced configuration. This can be enable during setup which allows for the customization of one or more of the following settings:
- MQTT base topic
- Prefix used for the created entities
- Device name

This can be used to created multiple Home Assistant integration entries for the same device-type (for example, for users with multiple CVE's). Or just if you want to customize the entry to your own liking.

## Available entities
The integration creates a device and sensors and uses a predefined MQTT state topic to distinct the devices. At first only a (by the authors) selected group of entities will be created. If you want to create all available entities for your device, you need to re-configure the integation entry:

Navigate to [integrations](https://my.home-assistant.io/create-link/?redirect=integrations) and find the `Itho WiFi Add-on`. Click the three dots of the entry you want edit:

Click `Reconfigure` and reconfigure the created entities

## Why don't I see all entities?
Some sensor are disabled by default. Follow these instructions to enable an entity.

Click `xx entities not shown` within the device or just navigate to the entity directly

Click the `cogwheel` icon

Click `enable`

# Installation

## Prerequisites
1. Working WiFi add-on connected to the Itho device(s) ([buy](https://www.nrgwatch.nl/))
2. [Official HA MQTT Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/) configured and connected to the MQTT broker. 
3. In the Itho WiFi add-on under 'MQTT' the `MQTT base topic` should be configured like the table below (or use the [advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration) to customize):
4. Home Assistant MQTT Discovery under 'MQTT' configuration in the add-on should be set to Off (default) if your fan is supported via this integration. 

| Device  | MQTT base topic   | 
|---|---|
| Autotemp  | ithotemp  |
| CVE  | ithocve  |
| HRU  | ithohru  | 
| WPU  | ithowpu  |

# Help us improve!
As we don't own all Itho devices ourselves, we don't always know the exact meaning and usage of an available sensor. You can help us improve the integration by providing feedback about:
- Translations
- Binary sensors. When a sensor provides only binary data (on/off, open/close, ...)
- Should a sensor be within the 'selected' group of sensors
- Should a sensor be enabled by default
- ...

Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/jasperslits/haithowifi/issues)!
